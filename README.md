As it currently is, I would hesitate to call it "complete", however it is certainly more than usable.  
All that should need to be done to your scene when using this package is to drop the TransparentWindow prefab somewhere into your heirarchy. After that... Nothing! It will automatically apply the appropriate settings upon Build to enable the transparent window feature.  

If you wish for an object to be "invisible" to your cursor and always be able to be clicked through, you can simply apply an "IgnoreCursor" tag.
